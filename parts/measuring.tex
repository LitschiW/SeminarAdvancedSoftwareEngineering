\section{Measuring and Predicting the Performance of Highly Configurable Systems}\label{sec:measuring}

By learning about the performance difference between multiple configurations it is possible accurately predict the a programs performance. This means that one does not need ot measure all (possibly exponentially many) configurations. Instead a small sample size should be enough to predict a programs performance. Multiple ways using diffrent methods have been proposed over time \cite{FasterDiscoveryofFasterSystemConfigurationsSiegmund2017}. This paper will take a look at
\begin{itemize}
	\item \hyperref[sec:AFID]{Automated Feature Interaction Detection} by \citet{AutomatedFeatureDetectionSiegmund2012},
	\item an \hyperref[sec:IncrementalApproach]{incremental/statistical learning approach} by \citet{VariabilityAwarePerformancePredictionJianmeiSigmundApel},
	\item \hyperref[sec:WHAT]{\textbf{WHAT}} a spectral learning approach by \citet{FasterDiscoveryofFasterSystemConfigurationsSiegmund2017},
	\item \hyperref[sec:ProjectiveSampling]{Cost efficient sampling by \cite{CostEfficientSampling_Gou_Siegmund_2015}}

%The test also show that for a low number of features a Brute-Force (BF) approach might also be viable. Measuring all configurations of Apache took about 213h where as the HS approach took 159h. BF guarantees a 100\% correct prediction where as the HS approach only had 94.7\% accuracy. Its is also worth noting that these tests were done on computers that are (from today's point of view) fairly slow \cite{CPUDatabase}. 

%Performance problems occuring after a while are not covered or predictable by these solutions. They go back to the old Holding problem
