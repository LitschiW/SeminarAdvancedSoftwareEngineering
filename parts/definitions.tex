\section{Definitions}

Before the actual approaches are discussed it is important to pin point the definitions of terms which are used in this paper.

This paper often uses the terms \inlineQuote{parameters}, (configuration-)\inlineQuote{options} or \inlineQuote{features}. These terms are all equivalent and describe ways to adjust and optimize functional and non-functional properties of a software system \cite{DistanceBasedSampling2019}.
One can divide into different types of options. Binary options usually have a value of 0 or 1 and describe the activation of a feature. Non-binary options support a wider range of values. For example this could be a setting for the stack-size allowed for a program. Non-Numeric options support the input of text. Those could be paths or other addresses.
The set of all configuration options is denoted as $\mathcal{O}$.


A \textit{configuration} can be defined in multiple different ways. \citet{DistanceBasedSampling2019} define a configuration as a function $c : \mathcal{O} \rightarrow \{0,1\}$. It assigns a 1 to each element of $\mathcal{O}$ that is selected and a 0 to those which are not used.
\citet{FasterDiscoveryofFasterSystemConfigurationsSiegmund2017} and \cite{VariabilityAwarePerformancePredictionJianmeiSigmundApel} have a similar approach. But instead of using a function to describe $c$ they use a vector or a n-tupel over $\mathbb{Z}^+_2(= \{0,1\})$. Each position of those enumerations is associated with exactly one feature. As in \cite{DistanceBasedSampling2019} a 1 indicates an activation of a feature and a 0 means that the feature is not used. These definitions obviously describes binary options only, but can be expanded to support non-binary options by using the codomain of $\mathbb{N}_0$ instead of $\{0,1\}$.

The \textit{configuration space} describes all valid configurations of a system. It is denoted as $\mathcal{C}$.

A \textit{sample} is the subset of a \textit{configuration space} that contains all configurations that are complied and measured during the process of sampling and learning.
