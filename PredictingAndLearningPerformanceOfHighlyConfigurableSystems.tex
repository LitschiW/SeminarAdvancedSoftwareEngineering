\begin{abstract}
  Today's programs are mostly highly configurable and customizable. Popular applications like Apache or MySQL can have hundreds of configurable parameters. Whilst providing flexibility to a customer, this also brings some problems: having so many options can heavily influence the performance of a software system. And the more options there are, the harder it gets to predict the behavior of a software system. This paper will show that a brute force approach to this problem does not work as a general solution. Further it is going to explain and compare four different prediction methods that were developed by N. Siegmund et al. The comparison of those methods shows, that there is no 'best' approach to this problem, but rather a broad selection of well working methods exists.
