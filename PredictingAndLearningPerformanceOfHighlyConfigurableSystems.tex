\begin{abstract}
  Today's programs are mostly highly configurable and customizable. Popular applications like Apache or MySQL can have hundreds of configurable parameters. Whilst providing flexibility to a customer this also brings some problems as have shown: having so many options can also heavily influence the performance of a software system. And the more options there are, the harder it gets to predict the behavior of software system. This paper will show that a brute force approach to this problem does not work as a general solution. Further it is going to explain and compare four different prediction methods for learning about the performance of highly configurable software systems. Also, the in this context often used machine learning strategy of Classification and Regression Trees is presented.
